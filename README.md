The platform is called **"Our Dome"**. The concept is a comprehensive, all-in-one platform for otaku, with various main features:

1. **Anime Streaming**

   * Offers a complete collection of anime from all eras.
   * Various subtitle options available.

2. **J-Pop Music**

   * Play Japanese music (e.g., J-pop).
   * Includes works from both indie and professional musicians.

3. **Manga and Light Novels**

   * A full collection of manga and light novels.
   * Thereâ€™s a feature for user-generated content, similar to Webtoon, but more general (not just comics, but also anime, music, and LN).

4. **Otaku Social Media**

   * A place for users to socialize.
   * Share short videos about their otaku passion.

5. **Content Creators & Professionals**

   * Creators can upload their works, such as music, anime discussion videos, vtubers, or works from both indie and large studios.
   * This section differs from user-generated content.
   * No direct monetization, but creators can earn income through affiliate marketing (advertising others' products).

6. **Marketplace**

   * Sell Japanese-related products (merchandise, J-pop concert tickets, etc.).
   * Includes a feature similar to TikTok's "yellow cart": purchases can be made via short videos.
   * For example, creators/vtubers/J-pop musicians who are part of the affiliate program can sell products via their videos.

7. **Games**

   * Play games directly on the website (online multiplayer).
   * Larger games that need to be downloaded before playing.
   * Users can also play external games (e.g., Valorant, Mobile Legends).
   * For communication between players, there will be chat, voice chat, and more.

8. **AI Chat Features (Waifu/Husbando)**

   * Users can chat with their waifu or husbando characters.
   * They can use pre-existing models, models made by other users, or create their own model.
   * To create a model, users must fill out a long form containing datasets (e.g., if asked "question A", answer "this", if asked "question B", answer "that", and so on).
   * This form must be filled with a lot of data to ensure a good dataset.

9. **User Communication Features**

   * Chat between users.
   * Create groups.
   * Voice chat, voice notes, send images, videos, or files.
   * Ability to make phone calls or video calls.

In essence, **Our Dome** is a super platform for everything related to Japanese culture: from anime, music, manga, LN, social communities, marketplace, games, to AI chat with waifus/husbandos.
